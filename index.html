        2024 Seasonal School on AI Trends in Signal Processing
      </h2>
      <p class="text-white">
        This summer course aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of
        Signal Processing in the areas of Image and Speech/audio Processing.
        Despite the robustness of Signal Processing algorithms, the development
        of smart and intelligent technology is on the rise with the introduction
        of AI. Seasonal schooling can assist students/research scholars to
        advance and gain a better understanding of signal-processing techniques
        as well as AI. The emphasis will be on applications of AI in Image
        Processing and Speech Processing, stressing sometimes overlooked
        concerns linked to hardware limits and system architectures. Attendees
        will be exposed to renowned signal-processing researchers and industry
        practitioners from the above backgrounds. A typical day at the seasonal
        school involves numerous lectures that provide comprehensive technical
        content on various elements of Signal Processing, followed by a hands-on
        workshop on MATLAB Toolboxes for Signal Processing led by industry
        specialists
